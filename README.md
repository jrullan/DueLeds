This is a library based on the Adafruit libraries for the WS2812B led strips, specifically for use by the Arduino Due. The peculiarity of this library is that it can control up to 8 simultaneous strips with up to 8192 leds with a refresh rate of about 30fps. This library was created for the Leds totem project.
